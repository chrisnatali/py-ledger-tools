## Usage

The output of any of the `2ledger` commands should be usable with ledger
for register, balance reports

### qif2ledger

Use to migrate Quicken data to Ledger format

Steps:
- Export each quicken account as a QIF
- Run them through qif2ledger to create a ledger formatted file
- [optional] Find/replace categories with appropriate account names
  I use the prefixes suggested in the ledger-cli doc (Assets, Expenses, Liabilities, Income, Equity)

Example using sample QIF file provided:

```
> python qif2ledger.py -a Assets:Checking sample.qif
2005/06/19 Opening Balance
    Equity  $-3134.0
    Assets:checking
